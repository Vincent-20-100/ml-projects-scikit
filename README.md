# ML-Projects-Scikit

This repository showcases several end-to-end machine learning mini-projects built with **Scikit-learn** and related libraries.  
It is designed to demonstrate my ability to clean data, build models, and interpret results using real-world datasets.  
Each notebook focuses on a specific use case: regression, classification, clustering, or time series forecasting.
